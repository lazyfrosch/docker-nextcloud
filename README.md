Docker image for nextcloud
==========================

This is a Docker image for [nextcloud](http://www.nextcloud.com) based on the [official owncloud image](https://hub.docker.com/_/owncloud/). For now please check the docs there.

There is a example [definition for Docker Compose](docker-compose.yml) to fiddle with.
